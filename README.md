# Wine_Quality_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a simple wine quality prediction model using Linear Regression. The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on various features such as acidity, sulfu dioxides, sulphates, alochol, pH, density and more.
